This repository contains the work for the CS764 project.

The project is about converting human understandable statements to queries
for the system to process. Involves a mix of NLP and database concepts.

The form where the user would enter the statement is created using django.

Databases:

The system requires that you have 3 databases in your system. I have
the following databases:
  trialdb: for django
  dummy: for storing the database on which the sentences will be formed
  train: for training the dataset

  More about these databases is present in database_parser/databases

Software Requirements:

The softwares and their versions are specified in the requirements.txt
file. Most importantly, for the nltk, once you have the software installed,
it is required to get the database and the descriptors for it. This can
be done by starting the python shell and running the command "nltk.download()".
Download all the versions.

Running the system from the terminal:

Running the nlp/final_wrapper.py would run the entire system from the terminal.

Running from django:

Start your django server:
  python manage.py runserver

Go to 127.0.0.1/user_query_input
The system follows from there
